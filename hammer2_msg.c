/*
 * Process state tracking for a message after reception, prior to
 * execution.
 *
 * Called with msglk held and the msg dequeued.
 *
 * All messages are called with dummy state and return actual state.
 * (One-off messages often just return the same dummy state).
 *
 * May request that caller discard the message by setting *discardp to 1.
 * The returned state is not used in this case and is allowed to be NULL.
 *
 * --
 *
 * These routines handle persistent and command/reply message state via the
 * CREATE and DELETE flags.  The first message in a command or reply sequence
 * sets CREATE, the last message in a command or reply sequence sets DELETE.
 *
 * There can be any number of intermediate messages belonging to the same
 * sequence sent inbetween the CREATE message and the DELETE message,
 * which set neither flag.  This represents a streaming command or reply.
 *
 * Any command message received with CREATE set expects a reply sequence to
 * be returned.  Reply sequences work the same as command sequences except the
 * REPLY bit is also sent.  Both the command side and reply side can
 * degenerate into a single message with both CREATE and DELETE set.  Note
 * that one side can be streaming and the other side not, or neither, or both.
 *
 * The msgid is unique for the initiator.  That is, two sides sending a new
 * message can use the same msgid without colliding.
 *
 * --
 *
 * ABORT sequences work by setting the ABORT flag along with normal message
 * state.  However, ABORTs can also be sent on half-closed messages, that is
 * even if the command or reply side has already sent a DELETE, as long as
 * the message has not been fully closed it can still send an ABORT+DELETE
 * to terminate the half-closed message state.
 *
 * Since ABORT+DELETEs can race we silently discard ABORT's for message
 * state which has already been fully closed.  REPLY+ABORT+DELETEs can
 * also race, and in this situation the other side might have already
 * initiated a new unrelated command with the same message id.  Since
 * the abort has not set the CREATE flag the situation can be detected
 * and the message will also be discarded.
 *
 * Non-blocking requests can be initiated with ABORT+CREATE[+DELETE].
 * The ABORT request is essentially integrated into the command instead
 * of being sent later on.  In this situation the command implementation
 * detects that CREATE and ABORT are both set (vs ABORT alone) and can
 * special-case non-blocking operation for the command.
 *
 * NOTE!  Messages with ABORT set without CREATE or DELETE are considered
 *	  to be mid-stream aborts for command/reply sequences.  ABORTs on
 *	  one-way messages are not supported.
 *
 * NOTE!  If a command sequence does not support aborts the ABORT flag is
 *	  simply ignored.
 *
 * --
 *
 * One-off messages (no reply expected) are sent with neither CREATE or DELETE
 * set.  One-off messages cannot be aborted and typically aren't processed
 * by these routines.  The REPLY bit can be used to distinguish whether a
 * one-off message is a command or reply.  For example, one-off replies
 * will typically just contain status updates.
