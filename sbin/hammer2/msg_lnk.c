/*
 * LNK_SPAN PROTOCOL SUPPORT FUNCTIONS
 *
 * This code supports the LNK_SPAN protocol.  Essentially all PFS's
 * clients and services rendezvous with the userland hammer2 service and
 * open LNK_SPAN transactions using a message header linkid of 0,
 * registering any PFS's they have connectivity to with us.
 *
 * --
 *
 * Each registration maintains its own open LNK_SPAN message transaction.
 * The SPANs are collected, aggregated, and retransmitted over available
 * connections through the maintainance of additional LNK_SPAN message
 * transactions on each link.
 *
 * The msgid for each active LNK_SPAN transaction we receive allows us to
 * send a message to the target PFS (which might be one of many belonging
 * to the same cluster), by specifying that msgid as the linkid in any
 * message we send to the target PFS.
 *
 * Similarly the msgid we allocate for any LNK_SPAN transaction we transmit
 * (and remember we will maintain multiple open LNK_SPAN transactions on
 * each connection representing the topology span, so every node sees every
 * other node as a separate open transaction).  So, similarly the msgid for
 * these active transactions which we initiated can be used by the other
 * end to route messages through us to another node, ultimately winding up
 * at the identified hammer2 PFS.  We have to adjust the spanid in the message
 * header at each hop to be representative of the outgoing LNK_SPAN we
 * are forwarding the message through.
 *
 * --
 *
 * If we were to retransmit every LNK_SPAN transaction we receive it would
 * create a huge mess, so we have to aggregate all received LNK_SPAN
 * transactions, sort them by the fsid (the cluster) and sub-sort them by
 * the pfs_fsid (individual nodes in the cluster), and only retransmit
 * (create outgoing transactions) for a subset of the nearest distance-hops
 * for each individual node.
 *
 * The higher level protocols can then issue transactions to the nodes making
 * up a cluster to perform all actions required.
 *
 * --
 *
 * Since this is a large topology and a spanning tree protocol, links can
 * go up and down all the time.  Any time a link goes down its transaction
 * is closed.  The transaction has to be closed on both ends before we can
 * delete (and potentially reuse) the related spanid.  The LNK_SPAN being
 * closed may have been propagated out to other connections and those related
 * LNK_SPANs are also closed.  Ultimately all routes via the lost LNK_SPAN
 * go away, ultimately reaching all sources and all targets.
 *
 * Any messages in-transit using a route that goes away will be thrown away.
 * Open transactions are only tracked at the two end-points.  When a link
 * failure propagates to an end-point the related open transactions lose
 * their spanid and are automatically aborted.
 *
 * It is important to note that internal route nodes cannot just associate
 * a lost LNK_SPAN transaction with another route to the same destination.
 * Message transactions MUST be serialized and MUST be ordered.  All messages
 * for a transaction must run over the same route.  So if the route used by
 * an active transaction is lost, the related messages will be fully aborted
 * and the higher protocol levels will retry as appropriate.
 *
 * FULLY ABORTING A ROUTED MESSAGE is handled via link-failure propagation
 * back to the originator.  Only the originator keeps tracks of a message.
 * Routers just pass it through.  If a route is lost during transit the
 * message is simply thrown away.
 *
 * It is also important to note that several paths to the same PFS can be
 * propagated along the same link, which allows concurrency and even
 * redundancy over several network interfaces or via different routes through
 * the topology.  Any given transaction will use only a single route but busy
 * servers will often have hundreds of transactions active simultaniously,
 * so having multiple active paths through the network topology for A<->B
 * will improve performance.
 *
 * --
 *
 * Most protocols consolidate operations rather than simply relaying them.
 * This is particularly true of LEAF protocols (such as strict HAMMER2
 * clients), of which there can be millions connecting into the cluster at
 * various points.  The SPAN protocol is not used for these LEAF elements.
 *
 * Instead the primary service they connect to implements a proxy for the
 * client protocols so the core topology only has to propagate a couple of
 * LNK_SPANs and not millions.  LNK_SPANs are meant to be used only for
 * core master nodes and satellite slaves and cache nodes.

/*
 * RED-BLACK TREE DEFINITIONS
 *
 * We need to track:
 *
 * (1) shared fsid's (a cluster).
 * (2) unique fsid's (a node in a cluster) <--- LNK_SPAN transactions.
 *
 * We need to aggegate all active LNK_SPANs, aggregate, and create our own
 * outgoing LNK_SPAN transactions on each of our connections representing
 * the aggregated state.
 *
 * h2span_conn		- list of iocom connections who wish to receive SPAN
 *			  propagation from other connections.  Might contain
 *			  a filter string.  Only iocom's with an open
 *			  LNK_CONN transactions are applicable for SPAN
 *			  propagation.
 *
 * h2span_relay		- List of links relayed (via SPAN).  Essentially
 *			  each relay structure represents a LNK_SPAN
 *			  transaction that we initiated, verses h2span_link
 *			  which is a LNK_SPAN transaction that we received.
 *
 * --
 *
 * h2span_cluster	- Organizes the shared fsid's.  One structure for
 *			  each cluster.
 *
 * h2span_node		- Organizes the nodes in a cluster.  One structure
 *			  for each unique {cluster,node}, aka {fsid, pfs_fsid}.
 *
 * h2span_link		- Organizes all incoming and outgoing LNK_SPAN message
 *			  transactions related to a node.
 *
 *			  One h2span_link structure for each incoming LNK_SPAN
 *			  transaction.  Links selected for propagation back
 *			  out are also where the outgoing LNK_SPAN messages
 *			  are indexed into (so we can propagate changes).
 *
 *			  The h2span_link's use a red-black tree to sort the
 *			  distance hop metric for the incoming LNK_SPAN.  We
 *			  then select the top N for outgoing.  When the
 *			  topology changes the top N may also change and cause
 *			  new outgoing LNK_SPAN transactions to be opened
 *			  and less desireable ones to be closed, causing
 *			  transactional aborts within the message flow in
 *			  the process.
 *
 * Also note		- All outgoing LNK_SPAN message transactions are also
 *			  entered into a red-black tree for use by the routing
 *			  function.  This is handled by msg.c in the state
 *			  code, not here.
